# DB_Audit
This is a dashboard I created for the proyect "Empodera tu mente en familia" in El Salvador. I used Shinny, a R package "that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R". It aims to keep track of the audit indicators we created to measure the data's quality through the  end-line collection. It's in progress and there are some changes I want to do haha. Please, use it as a template as you see more fit for it. Any comments are welcome.
